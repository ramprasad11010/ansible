This is a code for coping a file from local to remote servers using SSH password authentication. Run the below command for running the playbook.

"ansible-playbook play.yml -i inventory.ini -u root --ask-pass"

Here using -i we are passing the inventory file.
Using -u we are passing username
Using --ask-pass we are telling ansibile play book to ask for password before execution
